Rate-based approach for ancestral state reconstruction of life history traits

The following files are zipped with password protection, If you need password to unzip them, please email wujiaqi06@gmail.com

Sequences.rar: Alignment data

GeneBranchInteractions.rar: Its output file, "rate.pois.matrix.txt" is the gene-branch interaction matrix

PredictionPrecedure.rar: it reads "rate.pois.matrix.txt" and outputs the posterior probabilities of ancestral states of all traits.
