Rate-based approach for ancestral state reconstruction of life history traits

Sequences.rar: Alignment data

SequenceInformation.zip: Single-copy genes in Class Mammalia and information on genes used in this study.

GeneBranchInteractions.rar: Its output file, "rate.pois.matrix.txt" is the gene-branch interaction matrix

PredictionPrecedure.rar: it reads "rate.pois.matrix.txt" and outputs the posterior probabilities of ancestral states of all traits.
