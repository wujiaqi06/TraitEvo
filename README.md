The following files are zipped with password protection, If you need password to unzip them, please email wujiaqi06@gmail.com.

Sequences.rar: Alignment data.

GeneBranchInteractions.rar: It reads branch-length matrix, and outputs "rate.pois.matrix.txt", the gene-branch interaction matrix.

PredictionPrecedure.rar: it reads "rate.pois.matrix.txt" and outputs the posterior probabilities of ancestral states of all traits.

SourceData.rar: Contains predicted probabilites of ancestral states of all traits; branch effects predicted by 6 different models/data; branch-length matrix and gene-branch interaction matrix

SequenceInformation.rar: Contain sequence information.
